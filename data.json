        "content": "Do Wintertodt for a long time. If you want to get max stats in the most efficient manner continue until almost 99 firemaking, using the banked cakes for food. Your four warm items are the clue hunter garb, gloves and boots along with the rainbow scarf. If you wish to leave earlier to save some time this is fine. It is most efficient to do ‘hoptodt’ - hopping to a game where the wintertodt is around 60-70% energy, then fletching logs to get (just over) 500 points barely in time, getting the crate and xp bonus, then hopping to the next world. This is highest firemaking xp and highest loot rolls/hr, but does require a plugin/stream/scout to find the wintertodt energy percentages on other worlds. Shortly after this step it is a goal to get to level 46 fletching, if you do hoptodt (instead of no-fletch single world or multiskilling in the bank between games) you will get most of this fletching xp from todt but if not you will need more gp for fletching supplies. You may prefer to leave some firemaking gap for using an infernal axe at redwoods later (not efficient, but very low effort). Each infernal axe used this way gives 5.7m woodcutting xp and 875k firemaking xp. Levels 90-99 is 7.7m xp. If you want to take this strategy, stop training FM at level 98. Quests, random things, and 1.5 infernal axes at redwoods for 90-99 woodcutting will finish off 99 FM. We strongly recommend getting as many as possible of the following while at wintertodt: 128k gp + 2.62 gp/xp for fletching (the goal is level 46, so 68k xp). While exactly 128k gp is enough, it is recommended to get a bit extra in case you unexpectedly need more runes or want to deviate. 60 woodcutting (higher is better, you will need 70 later and the rest will be trained with sulliusceps and 2t teaks outside Soul Wars). You can get this elsewhere too. Uncut rubies and emeralds, at least 50 each (more is better, you will have to buy up to ~120 rubies so if you go lower you need more gp down the line. They cost 1k gp each, and emeralds cost 500 gp each). 8 uncut sapphires (more is better). 16 magic logs (for Desert Treasure, Mourning’s End Part I and Monkey Madness II. If you do not get enough you will need 75 woodcutting instead of 70). Note that you can only get magic logs by opening crates after level 50 woodcutting, so don’t open any crates before that point! Furthermore, the chance of getting them massively increases at level 60 woodcutting. It is therefore recommended to only open crates at level 60 woodcutting or higher. There is one more break point for opening the loot - after completing The Digsite quest, step 40 of chapter 1, getting better ores. Other skills and levels are not worth waiting for. The following logs for bird runs: 13 oak, 24 willow, 52 teak, 44 maple. 10 willow logs and 20 mahogany logs for the Varrock medium diary, 11 yew logs for the Ardougne medium diary, 1 yew log for the Desert hard diary, 1 oak, willow and maple log for Enakhra’s Lament, 1 willow log for Icthlarin’s Little Helper. About 10 regular logs for assorted use. Extra mahoganies and teaks are very welcome for construction. Oak logs to cut into headless arrows, to make arrow shafts for 46 fletching (only as many as needed - you will get 190 fletching xp per oak log). 3 more oak logs for Sleeping Giants (do not cut these into shafts) 30 construction (more is better, 30 is essential) 2 iron ore 1 silver ore 1 grimy ranarr weed 3 willow seeds 15 harralander seeds (or more lower tier herb seeds for similar xp) ~200 pure essence A raw swordfish (you can get this from tempoross later). Some silver and gold ore (~50 silver, ~100 gold is sufficient, more is better. If you don’t get enough you may have to buy some at the blast furnace later). Some fletching levels along the way (the guide will assume level 31, 15,500 xp, after this step, if you are over/under you can adjust your future plans for making steel arrows to 46 fletching accordingly). Optionally: do a small group kill on a separate world for 3000 or more points in one game for the Combat Achievement.",

If you have enough poor rng to hit 17 or higher magic you can use bolt spells to improve your chances. Carry chaos runes for bolt spells here! Complete The Tourist Trap, put both xp rewards on agility. Return to Ali Morrisane and complete The Feud.

It gets much better around level 55-60, so hang in there. this is the general method, only slown on the higher level bandits here but the setup is the same.

Charter a ship to Catherby. Buy steel arrowtips to round out 46 fletching (if you don’t have that level yet). We recommend buying 250/world to save hopping but if you are low on gp you can buy 100/world instead to save some cash here. Take out a knife from the bank and a light source (grab a candle along the way and light it with a tinderbox if you don’t have any). Grab insect repellant, collect two buckets of wax and five flax (diary) and speak with Sherlock (diary). Enter the Temple of Ikov and grab some Boots of Lightness, then leave again. Start Merlin’s Crystal up to the step where you need to visit Arhein. Run to Seers, grab the fishing pass and other items for fishing contest from the bank. Continue Fishing Contest to the step where you get the trophy. Fly fish north of Seers bank to 35 fishing, banking the fish. Complete Murder Mystery while training (start the quest, get all relevant clues in the mansion, fish an inv, bank, do the relevant steps in the village, resume the quest etc.). Home teleport to Lumbridge, cross the gate to Al-Kharid (costs 10gp), run south and speak with Hassan to start Prince Ali Rescue, then Osman to resume the quest. Run south and board Ferryman Sathwood’s ferry. Train fishing at mass world Tempoross to level 56. It is most efficient to cook the harpoonfish instead of using them raw. Make sure to only cash in the reward permits after you have hit level 50 fishing - this is a significant boost to your loot! From here on add steel arrowtips to your headless arrows as you move, to get level 46 fletching. You can make a fire underneath yourself to tick manipulate cook-fish fly fish (https://streamable.com/90mz74), but beware that you want to bank some trout for quests and salmon for food for later. Note that you need at least 15 cooking for this, so you will need to train some cooking on the side, for example buying raw fish from Gerrant in Port Sarim, to make this work. If you went all the way to 99 firemaking, and therefore also made at least 99000 gp in excess of the amount you needed at WT, make a detour to Ignatius Vulcan when picking flax and buy the Firemaking cape. This has some uses both as a light source and for defensive stats, but mostly it is just iconic. Tempoross will also give random amounts of planks, nails, raw fish, gold bars, gems and other loot that will be useful later. None of these are required but all of them will help down the line. There are several Combat Achievement tasks for Tempoross. It is recommended (but fine if you don’t) to complete as many of the easy and medium tier as you can during this Tempoross grind. Optionally you can stay for the fish barrel. It is a good item for barbarian fishing and for buying karambwans (Brimhaven POH method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME), some people also use it to fish karambwans (lowering the rate in exchange for longer trips, i.e. making it more afk). Staying for a fish barrel is not recommended. Solo methods for Tempoross exist, but they are difficult at low level and not recommended.",

Going for all three should take you to level 63 farming, which is (one level higher than) perfect for starting boosting (garden pies from the chef’s guild, and later in Cam Torum) medium farming contracts. If you do not want a seed box you can leave earlier, though level 62 is recommended. Go to the farming guild, get your first contract and preplant all other patches (if necessary go pickpocket master farmers for seeds). Maintain farming contracts as much as possible. You will need a whiteberry soon, so make sure to grow a whiteberry bush. While your farming is level 51-53 you can use garden pies to boost for Bologano seeds (takes approximately 6-7 pies total for these levels depending on the method) to significantly increase your xp. If you ever run out of garden pies, buy some more. Farming contracts begin here. The fastest and most efficient way to get to the farming guild is using the Kourend library teleport on the Arceuus spellbook into the minecart to the farming guild, blowing glass or fletching arrow shafts/headless arrows as you move. On your first trip to the Farming guild, first travel to the North side outside the guild and chop mahogany logs for the diary step. If you downgrade into a farming contract you do not have the seeds for the best way to get some is by pickpocketing master farmers. Preplanting and skipping contracts that take a long time (>3 hours for medium tier) to complete is an extremely good strategy to increase your contracts completed per day, see also the (hard contract, but applicable to medium contracts as well) flow chart in the contracts section of the farming guide below. The first time you go to the farming guild, grab six yellow dyes and seven red dyes from the shelves in the Getting Ahead farm. Mix one yellow and red dye to make an orange dye. Amateur herb runs begin here - meaning herb runs where you only visit the herb patches that are easy to access. Right now that is just the Morytania patch (Fenkenstrain teleport) and Varlamore patch (fairy ring AJP - though it is also completely fine to disregard this patch entirely), and soon you will add the Falador patch (Explorer’s ring teleport). Make sure to farm as soon as reasonably possible: 22 limpwurt roots (one is for the strength potion easy Kourend diary step, complete it at your convenience using the Kharedst’s teleport and then complete the easy diary, putting the xp on Herblore. Another is for the Varrock medium diary step. Make sure to plant at least one in Catherby for the diary) Whiteberries (in either the Champions’ Guild, the Farming Guild patch or the Ardougne Monastery patch). Two toadflax for agility potions (for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio and Making Friends with My Arm). Sweetcorn (for RFD/Sir Amik Varze). On one of your (future) herb runs plant strawberries in Ardougne for the diary (both patches recommended). You will need some prayer potions soon, so make sure to plant a set of ranarrs and snape grass early as well. Plant watermelons to harvestfill for making more compost. Growing harralanders for making energy potions is very reasonable, and they will come in handy. Note: until you get to Chapter 2, Step 66 you will be stuck with ‘amateur’ herb runs as the best herb run option. It is recommended to postpone herb runs until that step, while maintaining farming contracts and other hourlies. If you find you need herblore levels, potions or want to do herb runs anyway, check the farming guide linked below and ignore patches that are difficult to reach (on the Arceuus spellbook), doing runs with fewer patches instead. This means, for example, only visiting the Falador farming patch as many times per day as you have explorer’s ring teleports. Until Chapter 2, Step 66 all mentions of herb runs refer to optional, low efficiency herb runs. When you get palm tree seeds, make sure to plant your first in Brimhaven and second outside the Tree Gnome Village. When you get yew tree seeds, make sure to plant one in Varrock after level 68 farming and 60 woodcutting, to dig up for two yew roots for the diary. Based on our estimates you will need to complete around 200-250 farming contracts (starting with medium, downgrading if you roll something slow) to bank the herbs for level 70 using Barblore later. Even if you aren’t ready to farm the herbs yet it is worth collecting the seeds. If you are asked to complete a contract that you would like to do but for which you don’t have the seeds it is worth to pickpocket master farmers for a bit (for example in Draynor or north of Ardougne) to get it. The loot scales with your farming level (and the failure chance with your thieving level), but according to this Mod Ash tweet the farming scaling only has an impact on the ranarr, snapdragon and torstol rates so the other seeds are fine. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314 Save 6 spirit tree seeds to plant across the world and in your POH (also keep in mind that they can get diseased and die while growing), trade all others in for t5 farming contracts. Once you hit level 85 (boostable) farming you can plant Celastrus saplings, and harvest them for bark which makes battlestaves. If you want a bit more leeway with GP you can harvest and replant these at the end of the day/when you won’t be doing farming contracts for the next 13 hours or so even if you’re not on a contract. You should typically have a ton of seeds by the time you can plant them. If you are ever low on money you can alch the staves from celastrus harvests ‘raw’, or blow and charge more orbs for them. This is particularly relevant for HCIM, who might chicken out of wish to avoid killing green dragons in the wilderness later and then lack green d’hide bodies gp. Once you hit level 58 herblore, go back to Tithe farm to buy the herb sack. The best method to do Tithe farming at this level is . Despite the video title it is wise to carry several energy potions (because of your lower agility level). Unlike the video you cannot replant as you harvest because you have to refill your watering cans first. Now that grown plants in Tithe no longer die it is possible to do the 20x5 method. You can find a complete farming guide here: . It is more accurate and complete than the farming advice scattered throughout BRUHsailer. Please use this to plan your farming methods going forward.

Mine sandstone, ideally with 4s,, the modern method  at this south spot shown by Binxy, until you are 10k xp away from level 60 mining (you don’t have to buy any sand for this. Feel free to get the level instead, if you want). Buy the ancient staff from Eblis. Once done, head south (rebank at the Ruins of Unkah if needed), kill Jackals and Vultures for Rag and Bone Man II and desert diary. Do Enakhra’s Lament. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLJm_Zu0ro by 5th hcim LUL shows how to do 3s1g - an older high xp tick manipulation sandstone mining method that does not require stamina potions, increasing mining xp/hr but getting less sand. You can also do Enakhra’s Lament before mining the sandstone, so you can refill your pouches at the fountain inside the temple (camulet teleport). This is faster and also gives you a good opportunity to do hourlies. Keep in mind you now have to go to 3k xp from level 60 with mining sandstone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5BKbVXuBo shows how to use a gravestone method to have access to more waterskins during mining. By keeping the gravestone interface open the timer doesn’t run down. shows the 3t4s method (also linked above). Optional and recommended (but not assumed in the detailed XP sheet): mine 25k sand total for good low level mining xp, leaving the sand in the grinder. This gets you well past 60 mining. Now that you are level 60 mining you can solo the lowest level shooting stars that fell. One option to find one is to hop worlds, especially f2p worlds, on a location where the stars might fall. on Crandor is such a spot. Alternatively, use https://osrsportal.com/shooting-stars-tracker to find a convenient one. The celestial ring is worth collecting.

If you get a fremennik shield, keep it for The Fremennik Exiles later (in Chapter 3, Step 21). The easiest way to get to Rex safespot solo is called ‘xlogging’. This works as follows: You pray mage when entering the room. If Prime is on you, go back up. If Prime is not on you, regardless of whether Supreme is on you, run south immediately and swap to pray range. Run along the south edge with protect range up until you're all the way east Then, once east (pray range still up), trap Rex in the safespot, sip a prayer potion so you're at least 40 prayer points or so, and click x to close the client. Wait up to a minute for Supreme to walk away, log back on (or try a different world but there's a risk you're crashing someone). You're now on the east side and can deal with Rex only, you're out of range of Prime and Supreme You can find an example setup here The tome, cape and helm can be downgraded without issue. Use steel gloves over mystic gloves. If your Iban’s staff runs out of charges in this grind you have to trek through the Underground Pass to recharge it. If you run out of death runes during this grind buy more as needed. If you go significantly dry on the berserker ring you will not have enough GP to continue the guide, and will instead have to make more battlestaves from scratch. Alternatively you can start barbarian fishing for xp and growing cats in the meantime for death runes.",

Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking for RFD/Awowogei. You can get to the fishing spot by using the Arceuus Library teleport (the Arceuus spell, not the Kharedst’s) into the minecart to get back. This is faster than the Kharedst’s to Lovakengj. Example setup here - the gp predates the Zeah favour rework and is not necessary. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking later. If you decide not to, then you’ll have to do Mess Hall, which is slower. For an explanation on the Mount Quidamortem barblore (can be afked, just bank the sturgeons), see. Warning: this document is several years out of date, and just covers the basic idea. Maintain cats, bird runs, contracts and (hardwood and fruit) tree runs, and optionally also include herb runs. Collect misc for mahogany logs for bird runs whenever necessary. If you run out of/low on digsite pendants go buy ~80 more rubies in a gem shop (Ardougne/Kourend). If you prefer to do this as a low effort/afk activity you may instead choose to weave the fishing in during other steps (instead of grinding this all at once). The levels are not needed until step 64 of this chapter.

Complete the Falador hard diary step. Complete the Falador easy diary, putting the lamp on slayer. At MLM after hourlies you can run back from the Falador patch after a herb run, or use the Arceuus Spawn Point teleport to get back to Falador. Similar to the barbarian fishing you can choose to spread this out over multiple steps, although this time you need at least 72 mining by step 64 and you need to have completed MLM by step 73. If you think the coal and gem bag are not useful enough you can instead opt to first get ~68-70 mining through other means (in particular, sandstone or blast mining). This option will mean you will be short on gp and have to make a set of air staves from scratch to adjust. There is a tick manipulation method to significantly increase the speed of Motherload Mine (credit to Port Khazard and Drøgøn for discovering this). You can find a short example clip of this here: https://imgur.com/a/UkY7Ytj (the clip has a metronome sound for timing). The method works as follows: You need an adamant pickaxe, other tiers don’t work. The method, explained below in more detail, works the same way you would 3t mine (e.g. 3s1g, or granite) but on a successful mine, click the next ore again on the xp drop, so that the total cycle is 4t on a success and 3t on a failure. Note that ‘click’ here means ‘click processed on this tick’, so you have to give the input 1t earlier. tick 1: herb tar rock 1t away tick 2: interact tick 3: still interacting tick 4: herb tar rock 1t away (does nothing if succeeded) - this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you failed tick 5: click same rock u did in tick 4 (incase you succeeded) - this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you succeeded Theoretically this represents an increase of approximately 40% in xp/hr at level 70 mining, though realistically the gains will be lower due to having to move to a new spot more often. shows a recommended location (in the southwest corner) for having multiple veins close to one another. Alternatively you can pick a closer spot to the deposit chute but have to adapt more to veins depleting. shows the method in full, with an explanation in the description of the video. shows a non-optimised example clip, slightly north of the recommended spot.

Along the way you want to loot certain coffins for hallowed marks and generic loot. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility instead. The following coffins are recommended: On floor 3, loot the enchantment obstacle (only on the ONE side, , so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed focus (costs 100 hallowed marks) you will never fail the enchant and it will default to the lowest level enchantment spell you have on you. Without one the fail rate depends on the level of the spell and it will default to the highest one you have on you. It is recommended to use lvl-5 enchant before you have the focus, and lvl-3 enchant after. The XP gained for each spell is the same, regardless of level. On floor 3 each side has a grapple (, ). You may choose to loot these right from the start, but failing them loses a lot of time. If you collect the Hallowed grapple (costs 100 hallowed marks) it is optional but not recommended to loot these until level 82 to speed up getting other loot. Floors 1-2 are not worth looting, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. for floor 2 and see below for floor 1. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, ) but not to cross it. Alternatively this is required if you are hunting the collection log slots. Based on the above, the recommended order for purchasing the Hallowed items is Focus > Instances > Ring > Hammer > Grapple. If you have banked vampyre ashes it is worth buying the Hallowed symbol and using them on floor 4 only. It is not efficient to collect vampyre ashes. You may always buy a few Hallowed tokens in case of a terrible run, so that you may finish it in time (and buy new tokens after). You will be doing Fletchpalchre (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre). Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching. Once you have a little bit of cash restart misc to get teak logs for planks for building bridges (2400 total, 8 days). 10 teak 5 herb(/other) at Misc, along with 10 mahog 5 herb(/other) for future bird runs if you run low/out. Keep in mind that changing the Miscellania allocation works retroactively. Keep misc running even if you have enough planks for Sepulchre. Once you have enough planks, swap to 10 mahogany 5 herb(/other) for future construction training. As your cash stack grows just dump 7.5m in there (we will assume this going forward). You will only need these teak planks by the time you hit 82 agility, not before then. After Misc is up and running, buy arrow shafts and headless feathers (in smaller chunks) to get to a total of 1 million headless arrows through fletchpalchre.

        "content": "Note: if you are not planning to max you can reduce this step, although the lack of prayer potions might prove to be an issue for slayer later. You will also need to obtain more planks and train construction at your own convenience if you do not go to at least level 96 agility during this step. That being said, 98 agility at Sepulchre is a loooong grind, so give serious consideration to reducing/splitting it. Read this step in its entirety carefully. This step contains a huge Hallowed Sepulchre grind. After level 82 agility you are good for a while, but there is no real reason not to continue at Sepulchre. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility. The following coffins are recommended: Floor 4 has a bridge (only on ONE side,  so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed hammer you will never break nails while attempting to build this bridge, and it is highly recommended to buy this hammer before reaching level 82 agility. Floor 4 has an enchantment obstacle  (only on ONE side,  so on 50% of all runs). If you have (and continue to be) tick perfect this is not worth looting, as it means you will lose the timing for ‘sword skip’ (and the 1:20-1:23 lap time) on the next section. If you are not tick perfect up to this floor the enchantment obstacle is efficient to loot, and works identically to that on floor 3. Floor 5 always has an enchantment obstacle , a grapple obstacle  and a bridge obstacle , followed by a grand coffin . Every single one of these is efficient to loot. Floors 1-3 are not worth looting anymore, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, ) but not to cross it. You will be doing Fletchpalchre (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre) all the way to 98 agility. Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching. After Misc is up and running, buy arrow shafts and headless feathers (in smaller chunks) to get to a total of 1 million headless arrows through fletchpalchre. Alch (all) rune bolts for good magic xp along the way. We recommend buying the initial helpful items first and then spending a lot of hallowed marks on hallowed crystal shards (the teleports). Doing this for levels 82-98 will on average grant the following loot and xp: ~24.5m gp (not including the costs for fletching, nature runes, planks etc) 565k thieving xp, 444k construction xp, ~600k fletching xp and 3.2m magic xp (primarily through alchs). 6.1k cosmic runes (these are useful for enchanting bracelets for gp and jewellery for general use later) 8.1k death runes 44.7k law runes (these serve no long term purpose but can be used to fill a nexus, for example) 44.7k blood runes (a good initial stack for barraging during slayer) 44.7k soul runes (these have some uses for Arceuus and barrage spells, as well as being required for Tumeken’s Shadow eventually) 12.7k adamant bolts (next to useless) 1100 monkfish 102 prayer potions (4) 336 sanfew serums (4) (useful at DKS and the nightmare) 152 grimy ranarr weeds 336 ranarr seeds (~2.0k (4)-dose prayer potions when farmed, a good starting supply for slayer) 72 strange lockpicks (for Barrows later, although the meta is to only do a little bit of barrows, using around 5-10 lockpicks) 2.12 Rings of Endurance (88% chance to get at least one) 16.2k hallowed teleport crystals - this is more teleports than you will likely use for banking on the road of all activities combined to maxing, so instead it is a good idea to partially save the hallowed marks (e.g. for future updates, potentially amylase) or spend it on loot sacks. If you want a change of pace you can afk mine daeyalt essence for runecrafting later. There is also a high effort daeyalt (“dae-alch”) method: https://streamable.com/it7kry. You can do this grind in smaller parts, or quit entirely at a lower agility level. Example setup here. You can use Parasailer’s Hallowed Sepulchre calculator:  to check your loot, xp, material requirements etc. and customise your strategy. A few notes: This calculator only works for levels 82+, and does not include f1 bridge building for xp. If you wish to build this bridge adjust the number of bridges per run afterwards manually. The sheet is default set to sell law and soul runes. To fix this go into the ‘High’ tab (bottom left) and uncheck the boxes for selling those runes. The floor 4 brazier, , is not recommended as it is not efficient to collect the ash in the first place. If you already have some this is the best use for it though, after buying the hallowed symbol.",
