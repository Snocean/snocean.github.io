        "content": "Do Wintertodt for a long time. If you want to get max stats in the most efficient manner continue until almost 99 firemaking, using the banked cakes for food. Your four warm items are the clue hunter garb, gloves and boots along with the rainbow scarf. If you wish to leave earlier to save some time this is fine. It is most efficient to do ‘hoptodt’ - hopping to a game where the wintertodt is around 60-70% energy, then fletching logs to get (just over) 500 points barely in time, getting the crate and xp bonus, then hopping to the next world. This is highest firemaking xp and highest loot rolls/hr, but does require a plugin/stream/scout to find the wintertodt energy percentages on other worlds. Shortly after this step it is a goal to get to level 46 fletching, if you do hoptodt (instead of no-fletch single world or multiskilling in the bank between games) you will get most of this fletching xp from todt but if not you will need more gp for fletching supplies. You may prefer to leave some firemaking gap for using an infernal axe at redwoods later (not efficient, but very low effort). Each infernal axe used this way gives 5.7m woodcutting xp and 875k firemaking xp. Levels 90-99 is 7.7m xp. If you want to take this strategy, stop training FM at level 98. Quests, random things, and 1.5 infernal axes at redwoods for 90-99 woodcutting will finish off 99 FM. We strongly recommend getting as many as possible of the following while at wintertodt: 128k gp + 2.62 gp/xp for fletching (the goal is level 46, so 68k xp). While exactly 128k gp is enough, it is recommended to get a bit extra in case you unexpectedly need more runes or want to deviate. 60 woodcutting (higher is better, you will need 70 later and the rest will be trained with sulliusceps and 2t teaks outside Soul Wars). You can get this elsewhere too. Uncut rubies and emeralds, at least 50 each (more is better, you will have to buy up to ~120 rubies so if you go lower you need more gp down the line. They cost 1k gp each, and emeralds cost 500 gp each). 8 uncut sapphires (more is better). 16 magic logs (for Desert Treasure, Mourning’s End Part I and Monkey Madness II. If you do not get enough you will need 75 woodcutting instead of 70). Note that you can only get magic logs by opening crates after level 50 woodcutting, so don’t open any crates before that point! Furthermore, the chance of getting them massively increases at level 60 woodcutting. It is therefore recommended to only open crates at level 60 woodcutting or higher. There is one more break point for opening the loot - after completing The Digsite quest, step 40 of chapter 1, getting better ores. Other skills and levels are not worth waiting for. The following logs for bird runs: 13 oak, 24 willow, 52 teak, 44 maple. 10 willow logs and 20 mahogany logs for the Varrock medium diary, 11 yew logs for the Ardougne medium diary, 1 yew log for the Desert hard diary, 1 oak, willow and maple log for Enakhra’s Lament, 1 willow log for Icthlarin’s Little Helper. About 10 regular logs for assorted use. Extra mahoganies and teaks are very welcome for construction. Oak logs to cut into headless arrows, to make arrow shafts for 46 fletching (only as many as needed - you will get 190 fletching xp per oak log). 3 more oak logs for Sleeping Giants (do not cut these into shafts) 30 construction (more is better, 30 is essential) 2 iron ore 1 silver ore 1 grimy ranarr weed 3 willow seeds 15 harralander seeds (or more lower tier herb seeds for similar xp) ~200 pure essence A raw swordfish (you can get this from tempoross later). Some silver and gold ore (~50 silver, ~100 gold is sufficient, more is better. If you don’t get enough you may have to buy some at the blast furnace later). Some fletching levels along the way (the guide will assume level 31, 15,500 xp, after this step, if you are over/under you can adjust your future plans for making steel arrows to 46 fletching accordingly). Optionally: do a small group kill on a separate world for 3000 or more points in one game for the Combat Achievement.",

If you have enough poor rng to hit 17 or higher magic you can use bolt spells to improve your chances. Carry chaos runes for bolt spells here! Complete The Tourist Trap, put both xp rewards on agility. Return to Ali Morrisane and complete The Feud.

It gets much better around level 55-60, so hang in there. this is the general method, only slown on the higher level bandits here but the setup is the same.

Charter a ship to Catherby. Buy steel arrowtips to round out 46 fletching (if you don’t have that level yet). We recommend buying 250/world to save hopping but if you are low on gp you can buy 100/world instead to save some cash here. Take out a knife from the bank and a light source (grab a candle along the way and light it with a tinderbox if you don’t have any). Grab insect repellant, collect two buckets of wax and five flax (diary) and speak with Sherlock (diary). Enter the Temple of Ikov and grab some Boots of Lightness, then leave again. Start Merlin’s Crystal up to the step where you need to visit Arhein. Run to Seers, grab the fishing pass and other items for fishing contest from the bank. Continue Fishing Contest to the step where you get the trophy. Fly fish north of Seers bank to 35 fishing, banking the fish. Complete Murder Mystery while training (start the quest, get all relevant clues in the mansion, fish an inv, bank, do the relevant steps in the village, resume the quest etc.). Home teleport to Lumbridge, cross the gate to Al-Kharid (costs 10gp), run south and speak with Hassan to start Prince Ali Rescue, then Osman to resume the quest. Run south and board Ferryman Sathwood’s ferry. Train fishing at mass world Tempoross to level 56. It is most efficient to cook the harpoonfish instead of using them raw. Make sure to only cash in the reward permits after you have hit level 50 fishing - this is a significant boost to your loot! From here on add steel arrowtips to your headless arrows as you move, to get level 46 fletching. You can make a fire underneath yourself to tick manipulate cook-fish fly fish (https://streamable.com/90mz74), but beware that you want to bank some trout for quests and salmon for food for later. Note that you need at least 15 cooking for this, so you will need to train some cooking on the side, for example buying raw fish from Gerrant in Port Sarim, to make this work. If you went all the way to 99 firemaking, and therefore also made at least 99000 gp in excess of the amount you needed at WT, make a detour to Ignatius Vulcan when picking flax and buy the Firemaking cape. This has some uses both as a light source and for defensive stats, but mostly it is just iconic. Tempoross will also give random amounts of planks, nails, raw fish, gold bars, gems and other loot that will be useful later. None of these are required but all of them will help down the line. There are several Combat Achievement tasks for Tempoross. It is recommended (but fine if you don’t) to complete as many of the easy and medium tier as you can during this Tempoross grind. Optionally you can stay for the fish barrel. It is a good item for barbarian fishing and for buying karambwans (Brimhaven POH method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME), some people also use it to fish karambwans (lowering the rate in exchange for longer trips, i.e. making it more afk). Staying for a fish barrel is not recommended. Solo methods for Tempoross exist, but they are difficult at low level and not recommended.",

Going for all three should take you to level 63 farming, which is (one level higher than) perfect for starting boosting (garden pies from the chef’s guild, and later in Cam Torum) medium farming contracts. If you do not want a seed box you can leave earlier, though level 62 is recommended. Go to the farming guild, get your first contract and preplant all other patches (if necessary go pickpocket master farmers for seeds). Maintain farming contracts as much as possible. You will need a whiteberry soon, so make sure to grow a whiteberry bush. While your farming is level 51-53 you can use garden pies to boost for Bologano seeds (takes approximately 6-7 pies total for these levels depending on the method) to significantly increase your xp. If you ever run out of garden pies, buy some more. Farming contracts begin here. The fastest and most efficient way to get to the farming guild is using the Kourend library teleport on the Arceuus spellbook into the minecart to the farming guild, blowing glass or fletching arrow shafts/headless arrows as you move. On your first trip to the Farming guild, first travel to the North side outside the guild and chop mahogany logs for the diary step. If you downgrade into a farming contract you do not have the seeds for the best way to get some is by pickpocketing master farmers. Preplanting and skipping contracts that take a long time (>3 hours for medium tier) to complete is an extremely good strategy to increase your contracts completed per day, see also the (hard contract, but applicable to medium contracts as well) flow chart in the contracts section of the farming guide below. The first time you go to the farming guild, grab six yellow dyes and seven red dyes from the shelves in the Getting Ahead farm. Mix one yellow and red dye to make an orange dye. Amateur herb runs begin here - meaning herb runs where you only visit the herb patches that are easy to access. Right now that is just the Morytania patch (Fenkenstrain teleport) and Varlamore patch (fairy ring AJP - though it is also completely fine to disregard this patch entirely), and soon you will add the Falador patch (Explorer’s ring teleport). Make sure to farm as soon as reasonably possible: 22 limpwurt roots (one is for the strength potion easy Kourend diary step, complete it at your convenience using the Kharedst’s teleport and then complete the easy diary, putting the xp on Herblore. Another is for the Varrock medium diary step. Make sure to plant at least one in Catherby for the diary) Whiteberries (in either the Champions’ Guild, the Farming Guild patch or the Ardougne Monastery patch). Two toadflax for agility potions (for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio and Making Friends with My Arm). Sweetcorn (for RFD/Sir Amik Varze). On one of your (future) herb runs plant strawberries in Ardougne for the diary (both patches recommended). You will need some prayer potions soon, so make sure to plant a set of ranarrs and snape grass early as well. Plant watermelons to harvestfill for making more compost. Growing harralanders for making energy potions is very reasonable, and they will come in handy. Note: until you get to Chapter 2, Step 66 you will be stuck with ‘amateur’ herb runs as the best herb run option. It is recommended to postpone herb runs until that step, while maintaining farming contracts and other hourlies. If you find you need herblore levels, potions or want to do herb runs anyway, check the farming guide linked below and ignore patches that are difficult to reach (on the Arceuus spellbook), doing runs with fewer patches instead. This means, for example, only visiting the Falador farming patch as many times per day as you have explorer’s ring teleports. Until Chapter 2, Step 66 all mentions of herb runs refer to optional, low efficiency herb runs. When you get palm tree seeds, make sure to plant your first in Brimhaven and second outside the Tree Gnome Village. When you get yew tree seeds, make sure to plant one in Varrock after level 68 farming and 60 woodcutting, to dig up for two yew roots for the diary. Based on our estimates you will need to complete around 200-250 farming contracts (starting with medium, downgrading if you roll something slow) to bank the herbs for level 70 using Barblore later. Even if you aren’t ready to farm the herbs yet it is worth collecting the seeds. If you are asked to complete a contract that you would like to do but for which you don’t have the seeds it is worth to pickpocket master farmers for a bit (for example in Draynor or north of Ardougne) to get it. The loot scales with your farming level (and the failure chance with your thieving level), but according to this Mod Ash tweet the farming scaling only has an impact on the ranarr, snapdragon and torstol rates so the other seeds are fine. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314 Save 6 spirit tree seeds to plant across the world and in your POH (also keep in mind that they can get diseased and die while growing), trade all others in for t5 farming contracts. Once you hit level 85 (boostable) farming you can plant Celastrus saplings, and harvest them for bark which makes battlestaves. If you want a bit more leeway with GP you can harvest and replant these at the end of the day/when you won’t be doing farming contracts for the next 13 hours or so even if you’re not on a contract. You should typically have a ton of seeds by the time you can plant them. If you are ever low on money you can alch the staves from celastrus harvests ‘raw’, or blow and charge more orbs for them. This is particularly relevant for HCIM, who might chicken out of wish to avoid killing green dragons in the wilderness later and then lack green d’hide bodies gp. Once you hit level 58 herblore, go back to Tithe farm to buy the herb sack. The best method to do Tithe farming at this level is . Despite the video title it is wise to carry several energy potions (because of your lower agility level). Unlike the video you cannot replant as you harvest because you have to refill your watering cans first. Now that grown plants in Tithe no longer die it is possible to do the 20x5 method. You can find a complete farming guide here: . It is more accurate and complete than the farming advice scattered throughout BRUHsailer. Please use this to plan your farming methods going forward. This guide also has videos and resources on tithe farming.",

Short guide to low level earth orbs: Run to the earth obelisk with 26 unpowered orbs, rock cake (or enchanted symbol), paddewwa tab to get there and 3 valuable items (dueling ring, games neck, earth staff recommended. NOTE THAT 1-charge jewellery has lower value than an unpowered orb, only use 2-8 charge jewellery throughout for this method). Throughout this method you will keep your gravestone up, so make sure you always have at least one item (orb) in there! Never collect the last orb unless you’re done with this step. Rock cake down to low health and die to Chronozon or the poison from a spider (at the narrow entrance) at the earth obelisk. Teleport to the bank (if you do the entire process on a PvP world you are already at a bank chest and can skip that teleport). Sip an antipoison in the bank (to prevent poison splats from the spider interrupting your charging. Alternatively, you can have a skeleton/black demon attack you and run past while the spiders cannot attack).
